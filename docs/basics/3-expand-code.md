"Complete the ModuleItem entity to match the structure and style of the given Court entity. Keep all original variables and constraints from ModuleItem, but format it to follow Court's patterns: proper import formatting, consistent annotation spacing, default constructor with JPA comment, convenience constructor, and getters/setters formatted exactly like Court's. Maintain the original package name and column definitions while making it structurally identical to Court's layout."
